# Fetal-brain-transient-segmentation

An automatic model to segment the fetal brain into 25 ROIs (of left and right hemispheres), including transient regions such as Subplate and the Proliferative Zones: Ventricular Zone and Ganglionic Eminence. Trained with the developing human connectome proejct (dHCP) dataset [^1] - T2W MRI fetal brain scans of fetuses ranging from 21-36 weeks of gestational age. Please refer to [^2] and [^3] for the repository and paper regarding the reconstruction/regional segmentation pipeline. 

Further details on methods for training and validating the model can be found on our paper [^4] (winner of best paper in PIPPI workshop part of the MICCAI conference in 2023).
